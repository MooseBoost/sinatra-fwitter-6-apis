# Sinatra Fwitter 6 -  APIs

## Outline
 1. Explain how APIs can be used to extend the functionality of our programs. 
 2. Add instructions for signing up for Twilio.
 3. Include the `twilio-ruby` gem into the Gemfile. 
 4. Use Twilio to send a text message when the user submits their form. 

## Objectives

1. Explain what an API is and why we use them
2. Read API documentation
3. Incorporate APIs into Sinatra Applications

## Overview

APIs, or Application Programming Interfaces, allow us to programatically interact with other Applications. Ever see a live Twitter timeline on a different website? How about login to an app using your Facebook or Google account? All of this is possible because of APIs. 

Today, we'll be using the [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/) API to allow our Fwitter uses to text their messages to a friend.
